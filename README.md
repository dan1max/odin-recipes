# odin-recipes

Hello fellow reader, this project is a part of my walkthrough in the Odin Project.
This is my first-ever project in this programming world, but for sure not the last.

In this project I'll be doing a recipe, so I can practice my newly acquired html skills.


After doing the project, I encountered very few errors, which were basically little commands that I forgot to add.
This project has been fun and helped me to remember all the information I learned on the Odin Project.
